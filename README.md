# TNSDC-Face-comparison-using-deep-learning-and-CNN-algorithm

## App Details 
This app compares two photographs of the same person or two different persons against his/her face features like face landmarks, beauty score, face emotion, etc. If both photographs are matching with each other, the app result is “Both photographs are of same person ” otherwise app result is “Both photographs are of two different persons”.
This app is used mainly for a face verification process like “to deliver some confidential
document to you, courier boy first verify your face and then deliver a courier.”

Note: A facepp API is allowed only to compare image URL links of two photographs.

## Convert Image to URL using postimages.org. (Link : `https://postimages.org/`)

In this website, choose your photograph from your local drive by click on the “choose images” button and then this website will create different URL links after processing your photograph.

## Step 1 : Create and Login into Postimage.org
